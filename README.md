<h3>What HTML does</h3>
<p>HTML provides a hierarchical structure for documents.
It identifies headings, paragraphs, navigation, images, and other content types so that browsers can interpret and render them correctly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML does not handle layout, styling, or interactivity.</li>
    <li>Those responsibilities belong to CSS and JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Basic structure of an HTML document</h3>
<pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt; title here &lt;&sol;title&gt;
&lt;&sol;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Web page content goes here.
&lt;&sol;body&gt;
&lt;&sol;html&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Semantic meaning in HTML</h3>
<p>Semantic structure allows user agents to understand the role of each part of the document.
This includes web browsers, search engines, screen readers, and other automated tools.</p>
<p><strong>Correct semantic structure improves:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Accessibility for assistive technologies.</li>
    <li>Search engine indexing.</li>
    <li>Long-term maintainability of codebases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common structural errors</h3>
    <p>HTML documents follow a logical hierarchy where content is nested and ordered.
Headings define the outline of the page, and related content is grouped together based on purpose.</p>
<ul>
<p><li>A well-structured document remains understandable even without styling or scripts.</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>HTML is the foundation of the web platform.
Understanding its structural and semantic role is essential before moving on to styling or scripting.
<ul>
<li>Strong HTML fundamentals reduce complexity and errors in all later stages of web development.</li></p>
</ul>

<h4>Where to do your own HTML projects</h4>
<p>You can do HTML projectcs in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/index.php">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/yousefed/elasticui/tree/master/examples/demo/">JSfiddle</a> for example.<p>When your HTML project is ready you can upload it to the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.It allows you to store your code, track changes, and share your projects publicly.
From GitHub, you can publish your site using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> and turn your project into a real website on the internet.

This workflow teaches you professional development habits and prepares you for real-world web development.</p>
<h3>Why HTML is useful</h3>
<p>HTML is the foundation of every website on the internet.
It defines the structure and meaning of content so that browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies can understand it.

Without HTML, there are no headings, no paragraphs, no images, and no links.
Everything on the web is built on top of HTML.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creates the structure of a webpage</li>
    <li>Makes content accessible to screen readers</li>
    <li>Helps search engines understand page content</li>
    <li>Works in every browser on every device</li>
    <li>Provides a stable base for CSS and JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning HTML makes all other web technologies easier to understand and
Strong HTML skills are essential for professional web development.
